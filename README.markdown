# AI Agent with LangGraph, LangChain, and Streamlit

This project implements an AI agent using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), integrated with a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app for user-friendly interaction. The agent handles mathematical operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) and retrieves information from external sources like Wikipedia, Arxiv, and DuckDuckGo. It provides concise answers and maintains conversation memory within a session.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed (version 3.8 or higher recommended).
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install langgraph langchain-core langchain-groq langchain-community streamlit python-dotenv
   ```
4. Set up your GROQ_API_KEY. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual [GROQ API key](https://console.groq.com/).

## Usage

### Running the Streamlit App
1. Ensure the `.env` file is configured with your GROQ_API_KEY.
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.
4. Enter a query in the text input field and click "Submit" to receive the final answer.

### Running the AI Agent Directly
You can use the AI agent programmatically by importing the `run_agent` function from `ai_agent.py`. Example:
```python
from ai_agent import run_agent

thread_id = "my_thread"
answer = run_agent("What is 5 + 3?", thread_id=thread_id)
print(answer["messages"][-1].content)  # Outputs: "8"
```

## Examples

| Query | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| What is 5 + 3? | 8 |
| What is the capital of France? | Paris |
| What was the enrollment count of the clinical trial on H. pylori from Jan-May 2018? | 90 |

These examples demonstrate the agent's ability to handle mathematical queries and retrieve information from external sources.

## Howទ

### How It Works
The AI agent is built using LangGraph, enabling stateful workflows with **qwen-qwq-32b** as the language model. It supports:
- **Mathematical Tools**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus.
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Wikipedia, Arxiv, and DuckDuckGo search.
- **Memory**: Conversation history is maintained within a session using LangGraph's MemorySaver.
- **Concise Responses**: A system prompt ensures only the final answer is returned, without reasoning or extra text.

The Streamlit app provides a simple interface for entering queries and viewing answers.

## Project Structure
- `ai_agent.py`: Defines the AI agent, tools, and LangGraph workflow.
- `app.py`: Streamlit app for user interaction.
- `.env`: Stores the GROQ_API_KEY.
- `README.md`: This documentation.

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for suggestions or improvements.


## Notes
- An internet connection is required for external API calls.
- Ensure your GROQ_API_KEY is valid to avoid authentication errors.
